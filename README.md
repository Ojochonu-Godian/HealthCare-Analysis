# 🏥 Health Data Analysis Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard project that analyzes patient care, cost, and outcome trends across multiple U.S. hospitals. This project showcases how interactive data visualizations can uncover insights in the healthcare sector to support data-driven decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is built using **Microsoft Power BI** and leverages real-world healthcare data to visualize:

- Patient demographics
- Hospital performance
- Treatment outcomes
- Cost distribution and trends
- Readmission and discharge patterns

It provides a comprehensive overview of patient flows, outcomes, and operational metrics from over 55,000 records gathered from 10 U.S. hospitals.

## 🔧 Features

- 📈 Interactive filters by hospital, patient type, and diagnosis
- 📍 Geographic distribution of hospital services
- 🏷️ DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group) and procedure-level analysis
- 💵 Cost trends by facility and year
- 📋 Readmission and length-of-stay tracking
- ⚖️ Comparative metrics across hospitals

## 📁 File Details

- **HealthDataAnalysis.pbix** – The main Power BI report file. Contains all visuals, relationships, DAX calculations, and datasets (imported or connected).

## 📌 Tools Used
